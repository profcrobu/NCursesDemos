# NCursesDemos
New Curses (NCurses) library demos (with source code in C/C++)

I write some (demo) programs in C/C++ for teaching purpose only.
If you like to execute these programs in your computer (sorry, Linux only)
you have to compile source files with "magic" command make (for any directory you use...):

1) Chess - The program uses the Unicode version of NCurses. It shows the chess pieces on a chessboard
2) Flag - It shows the Italian flag. Useful when Italia's national football team plays in Mondial Championships
3) Hangman - Full featured version of a classical game Hangman. Sorry! Only for Italian people
4) Memory - Another classical game for experiment your memory
5) NavalBattle - Another classical...
6) Pacman - Text-only bases Pacman. Not completed, but you would play without ghost
7) Sudoku - Full featured version of Sudoku. With digit placement cheating! You must play with it!

All programs require terminal's setting of 25 rows x 80 columns, with exception of Pacman (31x80)

Enjoy very much!
