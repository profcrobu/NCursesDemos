# NCursesDemos
New Curses (NCurses) library demos (with source code in C/C++)

I write some (demo) program in C/C++ for teaching purpose only.
If you like to execute these programs in your computer (sorry, Linux only)
you must compile source files with "magic" command make (for any directory you use...)

Enjoy very much!
